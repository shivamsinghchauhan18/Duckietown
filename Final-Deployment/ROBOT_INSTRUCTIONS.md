# 🤖 SUPER SIMPLE - RUN ON PINKDUCKIE

Since you already have the repo on your robot, this is **SUPER EASY**!

## 🚀 One Command to Rule Them All

**SSH into pinkduckie and run:**

```bash
# SSH into your robot
ssh duckie@pinkduckie.local

# Go to your repo directory
cd /path/to/your/Duckietown-RL-repo

# Copy the run script from Final-Deployment
cp Final-Deployment/run_on_robot.sh .

# Run it!
./run_on_robot.sh
```

## 🎯 What This Does

1. **Finds your files** automatically:
   - Looks for `champion_model.pth`
   - Finds the inference node
   - Locates config files

2. **Installs dependencies** if needed:
   - PyTorch CPU version
   - OpenCV, PyYAML

3. **Tests model loading** to make sure it works

4. **Starts RL inference** immediately

## 📊 Expected Output

You should see:
```
🤖 STARTING RL ON PINKDUCKIE (REPO ALREADY ON ROBOT)
==================================================
Robot: pinkduckie
Using existing repo on robot
🛑 Stopping any existing RL processes...
✅ Found champion_model.pth

```

## 🔍 Monitor from Another Terminal

While the RL is running, open another terminal:

```bash
# Check ROS topics
ssh duckie@pinkduckie.local 'rostopic list | grep rl_inference'

# Monitor status
ssh duckie@pinkduckie.local 'rostopic echo /pinkduckie/rl_inference/status'

# Monitor commands
ssh duckie@pinkduckie.local 'rostopic echo /pinkduckie/car_cmd_switch_node/cmd'
```

## 🛑 To Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running, or:

```bash
ssh duckie@pinkduckie.local 'pkill -f rl_inference_node.py'
```

## 🎯 What Your Robot Will Do

- **Lane following**: Conservative, smooth lane following
- **Safe speed**: Max 0.3 m/s
- **10 Hz inference**: Real-time response
- **ROS integration**: Publishes to standard Duckiebot topics

## ⚠️ Safety

- Test in a **safe, open area**
- Have **emergency stop ready** (Ctrl+C)
- **Monitor behavior** closely
- **Human supervisor** should be present

## 🎉 That's It!

Since you already have the repo on the robot, it's just one script to run. Your champion model will be controlling pinkduckie in seconds!

---

**Just run `./run_on_robot.sh` on pinkduckie and you're done! 🚀**
