# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Duckietown Reinforcement Learning model by adding advanced capabilities for object detection and avoidance using YOLO v5, dynamic lane changing behaviors, and robust integration with the PPO training environment. The system will build upon the current lane following implementation to create a comprehensive autonomous driving agent capable of navigating complex scenarios with obstacles and multi-lane environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher developing autonomous driving algorithms, I want the RL agent to detect and avoid objects in real-time using YOLO v5, so that the robot can safely navigate around obstacles while maintaining lane following behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent encounters an object in its path THEN the system SHALL detect the object using YOLO v5 with confidence threshold >= 0.5
2. WHEN an object is detected within a safety distance of 0.5 meters THEN the system SHALL initiate avoidance maneuvers
3. WHEN performing object avoidance THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum clearance of 0.2 meters from detected objects
4. WHEN no objects are detected THEN the system SHALL continue normal lane following behavior
5. WHEN multiple objects are detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize avoidance based on proximity and collision risk

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the RL agent to perform dynamic lane changing when necessary, so that it can navigate around obstacles or optimize its path in multi-lane scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current lane is blocked by an obstacle THEN the system SHALL evaluate adjacent lanes for safe lane changing
2. WHEN a lane change is initiated THEN the system SHALL check for a clear path of at least 2 meters in the target lane
3. WHEN changing lanes THEN the system SHALL complete the maneuver within 3 seconds
4. WHEN lane changing is not safe THEN the system SHALL maintain current position and reduce speed
5. WHEN lane change is completed THEN the system SHALL resume normal lane following in the new lane

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive wrapper classes for object avoidance and lane changing, so that these behaviors can be easily integrated into the existing action and observation spaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing object avoidance wrapper THEN the system SHALL extend the existing action space to include avoidance actions
2. WHEN implementing lane changing wrapper THEN the system SHALL add lane change decisions to the action space
3. WHEN processing observations THEN the system SHALL include object detection results in the observation space
4. WHEN wrapping the environment THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing reward functions
5. WHEN using wrappers THEN the system SHALL preserve the original Duckietown environment interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the enhanced RL model integrated with PPO training, so that the agent can learn optimal policies for lane following, object avoidance, and lane changing simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training with PPO THEN the system SHALL use multi-objective reward functions for all behaviors
2. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL balance exploration between lane following, object avoidance, and lane changing
3. WHEN the model converges THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proficiency in all three behaviors
4. WHEN training episodes exceed maximum steps THEN the system SHALL properly terminate and reset the environment
5. WHEN using curriculum learning THEN the system SHALL progressively increase scenario complexity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the system, I want comprehensive logging and debug output, so that I can monitor the agent's decision-making process and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL log all object detections with confidence scores and bounding boxes
2. WHEN lane changing decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning and safety checks performed
3. WHEN actions are taken THEN the system SHALL log the action type, values, and triggering conditions
4. WHEN rewards are calculated THEN the system SHALL log individual reward components and total reward
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with stack traces and context information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want robust testing capabilities for the enhanced system, so that I can validate the performance and safety of the integrated behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL test each wrapper class independently
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test the complete pipeline with all wrappers
3. WHEN testing object avoidance THEN the system SHALL validate detection accuracy and avoidance success rates
4. WHEN testing lane changing THEN the system SHALL measure lane change completion time and safety metrics
5. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time processing speeds (>= 10 FPS)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want configurable parameters for all new behaviors, so that I can tune the system performance for different scenarios and research objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring object detection THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of YOLO confidence thresholds
2. WHEN configuring avoidance behavior THEN the system SHALL allow tuning of safety distances and reaction times
3. WHEN configuring lane changing THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of lane change criteria and timing
4. WHEN configuring training THEN the system SHALL allow modification of reward function weights
5. WHEN using configuration files THEN the system SHALL validate all parameters and provide meaningful error messages for invalid values
